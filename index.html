      <p>We came to Houston in 2023 after escaping the Taliban. In Afghanistan, we played soccer through the Afghan Football Federation. Some of us played with the national team or the youth national team, and others played with regional teams. When the Taliban took over, they targeted female athletes, so we knew we had to get out. After two years in Albania, we came to Houston as a group. In 2025, we organized a team for the first time in the U.S.</p>

      <p>Our team is called Houston Shine FC. We want to be a shining light for other women from Afghanistan and the U.S. to have fun, be united, and work hard through soccer. We wore red and black uniforms when we played in Afghanistan. In the Afghan flag, red means “blood” and black means “war.” Now we wear blue and white because they are the color of the sky. We play in the Houston Women’s Soccer Association league, where we have found support from other women players.</p>

      <h2>The Next Generation</h2>
      <p>Some of us work as youth coaches through the YMCA. We coach 12-14 year old girls from our community. As coaches, we are role models for the next generation of girls who want to express themselves through soccer. We are creating a space where girls from Afghanistan and other countries can feel safe and supported in sports.</p>

      <p>Thank you to Connect Community, Commissioner Lesley Briones, Precinct 4 Forward foundation, St. John’s School, Soccer Post, and the Houston Women’s Soccer Association for providing practice space, coaching, uniforms, equipment, and other support as we start the team.</p>
      <p>We are seeking additional support to help us achieve our goals of completing our educations and becoming professionals as nurses, midwives, computer programmers, dentists, and soccer coaches. Your donations are tax-deductible through the Greater Houston Community Foundation.</p>
